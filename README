Print the CPU identifier and feature flags in user land the same
way as the OpenBSD kernel does.  The code has been copied from the
amd64 kernel sources with slight modifications to make it compile
and run.  The result is an ugly #ifdef hack.  But the goal is to
keep the files close to their original.  This allows to sync them
easily from the OpenBSD tree in the future.
